# Cutting wants and variable spending

When overspending shows up in your budget, the fastest levers are usually **variable** and **discretionary** categories:
- Restaurants and take-out
- Shopping and online orders
- Entertainment and subscriptions
- Travel and “one-off” treats

Instead of trying to cut everything at once, **pick one or two categories** and set a clear limit for the next month (for example, “$150 less on restaurants” or “no clothing purchases until next paycheck”).

Look for recurring charges first. Cancel or pause:
- Subscriptions you rarely use.
- Automatic renewals you forgot about.
- Trial periods that became paid plans.

Small recurring cuts often matter more than one-time sacrifices, because they improve your cash flow every single month.
