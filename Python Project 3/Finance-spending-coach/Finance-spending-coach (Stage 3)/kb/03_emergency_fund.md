# Building an emergency fund and safety net

A healthy budget includes a plan for **unexpected expenses** (job changes, car repairs, medical bills). A common target is an **emergency fund of 3–6 months of essential expenses**.

You do not need to build this overnight. Start by aiming for:
- **$1,000–$2,000** as a “starter” emergency fund, then
- Gradually grow it to **3–6 months of rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, and transport.**

If you are currently overspending or saving less than **10% of income**, focus on:
1. Getting back to at least a **10% savings rate**.
2. Directing most of that into your emergency fund until you hit the starter goal.
3. Avoiding new fixed commitments (long contracts, big car payments, new subscriptions) while your safety net is still small.

An emergency fund should sit in a **simple, low-risk savings account**, not in investments that can drop in value right when you need the money.
