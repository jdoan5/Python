# NYC Popular Baby Names – Looker Studio & Plotly Dash

This project explores the **NYC Popular Baby Names** dataset and turns it into
two interactive views on the same prepared data:

- A **Looker Studio dashboard** (for a no-code BI-style experience)
- A **Plotly Dash web app** (for a Python-based dashboard)

The core idea:

> Use **Python** to clean and enrich the data, then plug the result into
> multiple front-ends that share the same enriched CSV.

The project helps answer:

- Which baby names are most popular
- How popularity changes over time
- Which names are **New**, **Rising**, **Falling**, or **Stable**

## 1. Project overview

### Data source

Public dataset: **NYC Popular Baby Names** from the NYC open data portal.  
The raw CSV is stored locally as:

- `Popular_Baby_Names.csv`

### Data preparation (Python)

Script: `prepare_baby_names.py`  

This script:

1. Loads `Popular_Baby_Names.csv`.
2. Cleans and normalizes columns (names, types, and values).
3. Aggregates duplicates by `(Year, Gender, Ethnicity, FirstName)`.
4. Computes **year-over-year change** in counts for each name.
5. Assigns a **trend label**:

   - `New` – first year the name appears  
   - `Rising` – more babies than previous year  
   - `Falling` – fewer babies than previous year  
   - `Stable` – same number as previous year  

6. Outputs an enriched CSV:

   - `baby_names_trend.csv`

Both the Looker Studio dashboard and the Dash app read from this file.
